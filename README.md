# earthquakes

This standalone HTML site relies on data from a geoJSON feed/API query.  The visualization has the following elements:

* Interactive map built with JavaScript
* Map tiles built with Leaflet.js
* Map layers and features built with D3.js

This visualization allows the user to interact with multiple views of the live data to see the pattern and magnitude of recent earthquakes.
